## Day 8

### Solution

Struggled also here. I spent some time trying to figure out how to solve it.
Don't actually remember everything I tried, but at some point I remember that 
a map and a linkedList-ish solution worked well on something last year, so I 
went for that and it worked almost immediately.

I also decided to parse as little as possible and try to work with the string,
just to save the hassle and for fun
