## Day 11 

### Solution

Part 1 went quite well. Part 2, I couldn't do.

The math was too hard for me on this one. I've spent maybe 4 hours
trying to google my way to the correct mathematical solution. I even asked chatgpt.
I actually stumbled passed GDC and LCM, but I didn't manage to understand it well 
enough to implement it. So I kept searching for other ways. 

In the end I had to have a peek at reddit to see the discussions. Now I'm mad and sad that I couldn't do or understand this.
I understood that I somehow had to reduce the size of the numbers without diving them. I still don't understand how it works tbh. Whatever.
