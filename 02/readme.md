## Day 2

### First solution
Nice task. Had fun designing the rules of the game. I think I
ended up with a reasonably understandable solution. The function
itself could be less messy.


### Second solution
Wanted to come back and try a "simpler" way
figured I didnt need to do so much mapping, and just creating a 2d slice of the score to be received
than get the index from the rune of the character.
Fun
