## Day 

### Solution

At first I over-engineered this one so much. I was trying to build a filesystem
and put everything in there. I spent maybe 2 hours this morning trying that.
But then I realized if I can somehow keep track of my folders while traversing the lines 
then I don't need it.


My original plan was to create a filesystem, add all the files there
and then recursively determine the size of the folders.

Wow, I liked the task though.
